# About

This is my user chrome for the Mozilla Firefox browser.
It is configured for usage with the **Tree tabs extension** as it hides the default tabs at the top.

The userchrome has to be placed in this location:
> %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\\\<profile>\chrome\userChrome.css

The chrome applies folowing changes:

- hides the tabs
- makes the tab bar of 1px height so that the window can still be grabbed
- removes margins and padding of bookmarks in the panel 
- removes sidebar header - useful for the Tree tabs extension
- removes folder icons in bookmarks, folders are represented with a black outlined label
